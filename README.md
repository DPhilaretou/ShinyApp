I have created a shiny application to easily convert measures: Length or Mass.
All you have to do is Run the application and select Length or Mass from the measure dropdown.
Then select an appropriate item from the item dropdown.
Then enter the desired value for that item into the textbox provided.
The table will automatically be refreshed with the converted values.
Please note that if you select an item that does not correspond to the measure selected then 
the values in the table will all be set to zero.
